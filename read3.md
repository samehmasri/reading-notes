## In this class we had learned how to deal with folders in our laptops using Terminal 

* you can find any folder by typing (( *cd* )) the name of the folder 
* you can list all contents by tuping (( *ls* ))
* you can creat new folder by tyiping (( *mkdir* )) and whatever name you want 
* you can creat new files by tyipng (( *touch* )) e.g touch index.html
* to go back to the previous folder you can use (( *cd ..* ))

## Using Git and GitHub

# git is a command tool to used to communicate with GitHub 
# Here are some steps :
* git clone (paste the link from github)
* git status
* git add .
* git commit -m 'anything'
* git push origin main

## Also you can use these two information to you from what we learned : 

* By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

* By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
