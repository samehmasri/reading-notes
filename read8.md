# Comparison and logical operators and functions 

* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.

* An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.

* Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).


## for and while loops

# For loop
* if you need to run a specific number of times,use a for loop.
in the for loop usually a counter which is used to tell how many
time the loop should run.

# While loop
* if you dont know how many times the code should run, you can use while loop
the condition can be something other than a counter. the will loop will run for infintie.
